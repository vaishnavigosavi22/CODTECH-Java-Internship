# Task 2: Java REST API Client

## CODTECH Internship Task

This Java application demonstrates consuming and parsing JSON data
and displaying it in a structured format.

Due to network firewall restrictions, a local JSON file is used
to simulate REST API data.

### Features
- Reads JSON data
- Parses JSON using org.json library
- Displays user details in structured format

### Tools & Technologies
- Java
- NetBeans IDE
- org.json library

### How to Run
1. Open the project in NetBeans
2. Run ApiClient.java
3. Output will be displayed in console

### Note
Public REST API access may be restricted in some networks.
Hence, offline JSON data is used.
